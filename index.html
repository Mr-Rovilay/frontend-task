        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Become proficient in Becoming aa Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Over the next two years, I aim to deepen my understanding and
              skills in Next.js, React, Tailwind, JavaScript, Phyton, and Git
              and GitHub. This includes building complex, dynamic web
              applications that leverage the full power of these frameworks. I
              plan to follow tutorials, take advanced courses, and build
              multiple projects to solidify my knowledge.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Contribute to open-source projects</h3>
            <p>
              Giving back to the community is important to me. I will actively
              seek out and contribute to open-source projects related to my
              areas of interest, such as web development and software
              engineering. This will not only improve my coding skills but also
              help me connect with other developers and learn from their
              experiences.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Build a portfolio of tech blogs</h3>
            <p>
              Writing about technology is a passion of mine. Over the next two
              years, I will create and maintain a tech blog where I share
              insights, tutorials, and updates on the latest trends in the tech
              industry. This will help me improve my communication skills and
              establish my presence in the tech community.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Gain expertise in backend development with Node.js</h3>
            <p>
              While I have a good understanding of frontend development, I want
              to become equally proficient in backend development. I will focus
              on learning Node.js, building RESTful APIs, and working with
              databases. This will enable me to become a full-stack developer
              and take on more complex and comprehensive projects.
